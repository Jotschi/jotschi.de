  This small program will be called by Autorun.ini. The program itself just executes Index.html. This means Index.html will be opened in the default webbrowser.

CD-Rom Autorun
This small program will be called by Autorun.ini. The program itself just executes Index.html. This means Index.html will be opened in the default webbrowser. In comparision to some other methods i discovered while searching for a solution this one won't open a consol window or something else.</p>

Compile with:

[source, bash]
----
gcc  -o open.exe  start.c res.o -mwindows
----

Code:

[source, c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst,HINSTANCE hprev,LPSTR cmdline,int cmdshow)
{
  HINSTANCE hInst = ShellExecute(0   ,"open","index.html",NULL , 0,  SW_SHOW);
return 0;
}
