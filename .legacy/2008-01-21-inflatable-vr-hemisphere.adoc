excerpt: "Using an inflatable hemisphere as base for a virtual reality cave is in
  my mind a very good idea because you don't need any structures that stabilize the
  cave and you might only need one beamer to get a full 360Ã\x82Â° view shown inside
  the cave. This is done by projecting the image from above the cave onto its material."
