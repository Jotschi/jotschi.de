Some Star Trek Quotes i like.
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-203"></a>

<blockquote>
And he piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the rage and hate felt by his whole race. If his chest had been a cannon, he would have shot his heart upon it.
</blockquote>
(Jean-Luc Picard: Star Trek 8: Der Erste Kontakt "First Contact")
