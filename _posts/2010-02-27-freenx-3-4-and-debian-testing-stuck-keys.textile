title: FreeNX 3.4 and Debian Testing - Stuck Keys

excerpt: |
  When using FreeNX 3.4 as server version i stumbled uppon an odd problem. My control (ctrl right) and alt gr key got stuck. By using xev i found out that the keyup event was never triggered. If i disabled the powerful freenx compression the event was handled correctly. 
  
  The solution was rather simple. I just reverted to 3.3 and everything seems to work now properly.
