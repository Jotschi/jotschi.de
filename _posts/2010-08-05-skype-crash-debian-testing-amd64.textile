Skype is crashing on debian testing in different situations with the following error message:

{% snippet c %}
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 611: _dl_open: Assertion `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args.nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed! 
{% endsnippet %}

<strong>Solution</strong>: Just delete /usr/lib32/libpulse* which is shipped within the ia32-libs package.
