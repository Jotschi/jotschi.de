Mainly i used this guide: <a href="http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Debian_Installation_Guide">http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Debian_Installation_Guide</a>

There were some glitches because of missing files and creation of diverations. I belive the uninstallation of fglrx does not revert created diverations of certain libraries. (I dunno if the removeal of created diverations this is the expected behaviour of package removeal)

My short Howto:
0. Optional: 
I removed non-free from my source.lst and did an apt-get update and apt-get clean to make sure that the module assistent would not fetch some fglrx packages via network.

1. Stop X

2. unload fglrx module
{% snippet c %}
modprobe -r fglrx 
{% endsnippet %}

3. Install additional packages you might need:
{% snippet c %}
apt-get install module-assistant build-essential fakeroot dh-make debconf bzip2 wget libstdc++5 ia32-libs
apt-get install kernel-headers-$(uname -r)
{% endsnippet %}

4. Remove all fglrx packages. You might have to change the order of command due to dependencies between the packages.
<code>dpkg -l | grep fglrx
dpkg -P  fglrx-amdcccle 
dpkg -P fglrx-driver-dev 
dpkg -P fglrx-kernel-src
dpkg -P fglrx-kernel-2.6.26-2-amd64
dpkg -P fglrx-driver</code>    

5. To restore the files that might have been deleted by the fglrx package removeal routines you can use:
{% snippet c %}
apt-get --reinstall install libgl1-mesa-glx
apt-get --reinstall install xserver-xorg-core
apt-get --reinstall install ia32-libs
{% endsnippet %}

6. Create the fglrx packages:
{% snippet c %}
./ati-driver-installer-9-4-x86.x86_64.run --extract fglrx_9-4
cd fglrx_9-4
cd arch/x86_64/usr/X11R6
ln -s lib64 lib
cd ../../..
./packages/Debian/ati-packager.sh --buildpkg testing
cd ..
{% endsnippet %}

7. Remove leftovers of previous installations:
{% snippet c %}
rm /usr/src/fglrx.tar.bz2
rm /usr/src/*fglrx*.deb
{% endsnippet %}

8. Install the packages. You might have to change the order due to dependencies.
{% snippet c %}
dpkg -i fglrx-driver_8.602-1_amd64.deb
dpkg -i fglrx-amdcccle_8.602-1_amd64.deb
dpkg -i fglrx-driver-dev_8.602-1_amd64.deb
dpkg -i fglrx-kernel-src_8.602-1_amd64.deb
{% endsnippet %}

<strong>Note: diversion problem</strong>
I got some nasty failure while installing fglrx-driver_8.602-1_amd64.deb
The package installation script was complaining about a failure while creating a diversion of libGL.so.1.2 because that file was used by the package xserver-xorg-core.
The installation terminated with:
<code>dpkg: error processing xorg-driver-fglrx</code>
You can get rid of those failures by using the <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages">Debian Package Search</a>. Use the last form of the page to locate the file (e.g. libGL.so.1.2)
As you see the file /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2 is part of fglrx and the package libgl1-mesa-glx. I just reinstalled libgl1-mesa-glx and fixed the bug. <del datetime="2009-05-19T21:01:33+00:00">You may also remove the package because you wont need mesa once using hardware acceleration. (Please correct me if this is wrong - I'm not quite sure about this)
</del>

Once you get only the following error you can proceed with dpkg --force-all:
<strong>trying to overwrite `/usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.soâ€™, which is also in package xserver-xorg-core</strong>

Finally i had to use the --force-all option to install the package. 
{% snippet c %}
dpkg --force-all -i fglrx-driver_8.602-1_amd64.deb
{% endsnippet %}

<strong>You should try to use the procedure described above before taking this quite drastic step. </strong>

9. Build and install the fglrx kernel module. I had not to modify the sources in any way.
{% snippet c %}
module-assistant auto-install fglrx-kernel-src
{% endsnippet %}

10. Load the module:
{% snippet c %}
modprobe fglrx
{% endsnippet %}

11. Make sure it was loaded. If it wasn't loaded use dmesg to check what happed.
{% snippet c %}
lsmod | grep fglrx
{% endsnippet %}

12. If you want to create a new xorg.conf file which stores your monitor setup etc.:
{% snippet c %}
mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg (just follow the instructions)
aticonfig --initial
{% endsnippet %}

13. You are done. Now start X and run the amdcccle tool and setup your screens. I had to run those steps to get dual head working:
* Enable both displays using amdcccle
* Set the resolution of both displays to the same one
* Enabling Xinerama
* Restart X
* Enabling Multi-Display Settings (Left of ..)
* Restart X
* Disabling Xinerama in /etc/X11/xorg.conf 
* Restart X

Download my xorg.conf:
<a href='/downloads/xorg/xorg.conf'>xorg.conf</a>

Overall this is a painstaking way of setting up dual head display and drivers. Please AMD / ATI create an Installer that creates valid Deb. packages or even better delete it and create a deb repository that everybody can use.
