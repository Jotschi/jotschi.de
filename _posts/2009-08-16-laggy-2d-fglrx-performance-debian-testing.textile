I just made a dist upgrade and after starting X my 2D performance was awful. I checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log and found out that DRI had not been initialized. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-357"></a>
Reason for this was an update of libdrm2 to a newer version. 

<code>Preparing to replace libdrm2 2.3.1-2 (using .../libdrm2_2.4.12-1_i386.deb) ...
Unpacking replacement libdrm2 ...
</code>

libdrm2_2.4.12-1 will not work with
<code>fglrx-driver                         8.62-1                      Video driver for the ATI graphics accelerators
</code>

Solution: 
Install the old libdrm2 version and restart X.
