  Some time ago i wrote a small library in someway similar to the osmParse library. It has a smaller footprint in comparison to the josm library. The sources can be found <a href="https://github.com/Jotschi/libTinyOSM">here</a>.
  
  I also migrated a small ruby file to java which contains useful lon/lat to utm conversion methods. These sources can be found <a href="https://github.com/Jotschi/geoconvert">here</a>.

The libTinyOSM contains a small example that shows how both (libTinyOSM and geoconvert) work together to get drawable data from the osm api.

Here is a screenshot that shows the rendered data:
