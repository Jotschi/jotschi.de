excerpt: "Using an inflatable hemisphere as base for a virtual reality cave is in my mind a very good idea because you don't need any structures that stabilize the cave and you might only need one beamer to get a full 360\xC3\x82\xC2\xB0 view shown inside the cave. This is done by projecting the image from above the cave onto its material."
