  Wuarg! Again PAIN with fglrx. I just setup a fresh and clean debian installation but fglrx just creates pain. 
  Well.. fglrx installed fine (with the known errors) the module compiled and everything looked ok but i wasn't able to setup Dual-Head because amdcccle gave me no option to select a Multi-Monitor arragnement. There were only two options: Single (Indipendent Position) and Unknown. I solved the issue.

I had to overwrite the /etc/ati/amdpcsdb file with one i saved from a working installation.<a href='/downloads/ati/amdpcsdb'>Download /etc/ati/amdpcsdb</a>. I used this <a href='/downloads/xorg/xorg.conf_workingfine'>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</a> X11 configuration file. 


I belive the amdcccle does not create a correct amdpcsdb file from the amdpcsdb.default file.
