  This small program will be called by Autorun.ini. The program itself just executes Index.html. This means Index.html will be opened in the default webbrowser. In comparision to some other methods i discovered while searching for a solution this one won't open a consol window or something else.</p>

Compile with:

{% snippet c %}
gcc  -o open.exe  start.c res.o -mwindows
{% endsnippet %}

<p>Code:<br />
{% snippet c %}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst,HINSTANCE hprev,LPSTR cmdline,int cmdshow)
{
  HINSTANCE hInst = ShellExecute(0   ,"open","index.html",NULL , 0,  SW_SHOW);
return 0;
}
{% endsnippet %}
