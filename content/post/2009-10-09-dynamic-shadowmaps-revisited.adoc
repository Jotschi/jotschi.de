Shadow Maps have one big disadvantage. Using low resolution shadow maps can result in pixelated shadows.

1024x1024 Shadow Map:

512x512 Shadow Map:

512x512 Shadow Map with an narrow view angle of the shadow map view:

You can also mix two shadow maps. Here i mixed a 512x512 shadow map with a 1024x1024 shadow map:

The scene contained two light sources which casted two shadows - the left one and the right one.
