Sometimes it is useful to forward a tcp connection to another server. For example if you want to switch a web service to another servers with no DNS delay.

You have to enable ip_forward and nat for the given port using iptables.

[source, bash]
----
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination someip:80
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
