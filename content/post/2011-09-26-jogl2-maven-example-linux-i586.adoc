I just uploaded a small maven project <a href="https://github.com/Jotschi/jogl2-example">to GitHub</a> that shows how to work with http://maven.apache.org[Maven] and http://www.jogamp.org[JOGL2]. 
The example also make usage of the ClassPathLoader mechanism i described in <a href="http://www.jotschi.de/?p=660">my other post</a>.

I added the jogl2 libraries by using the system scope since i could not find a maven repository with those libraries. The example currently works only with i586 linux. But i could be easily modified to handle other architectures as well.

Update: I migrated the nehe JOGL examples which i found <a href="http://www.java-tips.org/other-api-tips/jogl/vertex-buffer-objects-nehe-tutorial-jogl-port-2.html">here</a> to make use of jogl2.
