I got problem with video playback when using the fglrx drivers as you can tell by the image below.

<a href="/images/ati/crappy_video.png"><img src="/images/ati/crappy_video.png" alt="" title="crappy_video" width="200" height="152" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-277" /></a>

Playing movies which include rapid motions produce these teared video frames. This problem is cause by the missing vsync. Apparently fglrx does not support vsync for xv yet ( fglrxinfo: 2.1.8591 / Driver Package: 8.602-1 / Installer Package: ati-driver-installer-9-4-x86.x86_64.run )

You can enable vsync for OpenGL:
<code>sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv
sudo sudo aticonfig --sync-video=on
sudo aticonfig --vs=on</code>

Thus now you can use mplayer -vo gl somefile.mkv to play your movies with vsync enabled. Of course gl output is a lot slower than xv. 

<blockquote>
Xv currently has no vsync with fglrx, so there is no other way than using opengl as output.

Update: That workaround gave me a better image on one monitor (less tearing) but there is still tearing in the image.

If someone knows a solution for this issue please let me know.
