The HiRISE Team invited people to search their image data for the missing polar lander that crashed 1999 on Mars.

The lander itself looks like this:

I joined and tried to find the lander. I found these places:

I found this one:
PSP_005958_1025_RED.JP2 - X: 12020px  - Y: 3930px

With some imagination it looks like a crashed lander with two solar panels in the north of the object.

I found this one:

PSP_005958_1025_RED.JP2 - X: 9644px  - Y: 5586px

It might be just a small cloud above a small hill or a dust devil (not possible so far north?) or it might be something else.
