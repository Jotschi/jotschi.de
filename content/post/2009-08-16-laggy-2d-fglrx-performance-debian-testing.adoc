Reason for this was an update of libdrm2 to a newer version. 

[source, bash]
----
Preparing to replace libdrm2 2.3.1-2 (using .../libdrm2_2.4.12-1_i386.deb) ...
Unpacking replacement libdrm2 ...
----

libdrm2_2.4.12-1 will not work with

[source, bash]
----
fglrx-driver                         8.62-1                      Video driver for the ATI graphics accelerators

Solution:
 
Install the old libdrm2 version and restart X.
